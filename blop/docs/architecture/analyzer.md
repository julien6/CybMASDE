# Component Specification: Analyzer

## Overview
The `Analyzer` component in CybMASDE is responsible for post-training analysis of agent behavior. It generates new trajectories using the trained joint policy in a simulated environment and extracts meaningful organizational patterns from these trajectories using the TEMM framework.

It helps to evaluate the conformity and explainability of the agentsâ€™ behavior with respect to roles and goals defined (or emerging) during training.

---

## Responsibilities
- Query the latest policy via the `joint policy tester`.
- Simulate trajectories using the `ODF exposer`.
- Feed simulated trajectories into `TEMM` for organizational analysis.
- Output a refined or enriched `MOISE+MARL model` including inferred roles and goals.

## Configuration Parameters
| Parameter                   | Type    | Description |
|-----------------------------|---------|-------------|
| `policy_tester_url`         | string  | URL to access the joint policy tester. |
| `odf_exposer_url`           | string  | URL to simulate the environment via ODF. |
| `temm_path`                 | string  | Path to the TEMM executable or module. |
| `analysis_episodes`         | int     | Number of simulated episodes to generate. |
| `output_model_path`         | string  | Path to store the enriched MOISE+MARL model. |
| `logging_level`             | string  | Logging verbosity. |

## External Interfaces

### Consumes
| Method | Endpoint                  | Description |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------|
| POST   | `/get_next_joint_action` | Get actions from the joint policy tester. |
| POST   | `/step` (ODF exposer)     | Simulate next observation in the environment. |

### Produces
| Output File | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `enriched_model.yaml` | Refined MOISE+MARL model with inferred structure. |

## Internal Logic

### Key Methods
| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `simulate_trajectories()` | Runs policy in ODF simulator to generate episodes. |
| `analyze_trajectories()` | Uses TEMM to extract roles/goals from generated data. |
| `save_model()` | Persists the enriched organizational model to disk. |

### Activity Diagram (PlantUML)
```plantuml
@startuml
start
:Load configuration;
:Start simulation loop;
repeat
  :Query /get_next_joint_action;
  :Call /step with joint action;
  :Store (obs, action);
repeat while (episodes < analysis_episodes)
:Call TEMM with trajectory data;
:Generate enriched MOISE+MARL model;
:Save model to output path;
stop

---

## Startup Behavior
- Load configuration.
- Initialize policy access and simulator endpoint.
- Prepare temporary directory or data buffer for trajectories.

---

## Shutdown Behavior
- Gracefully finish current episode.
- Ensure all collected data is flushed to file.
- Save generated organizational model.

---

## Error Handling
- Retries policy or simulation queries on failure.
- Logs analysis errors or inconsistencies.
- Reports if model generation fails.

---

## Notes
- This component is designed to work independently after training is complete.
- It complements initial MOISE+ definitions by extracting emergent behavior.
- Useful both for validation and for policy iteration.

---

## Next Steps
- Define exact trajectory format used by TEMM.
- Provide example analysis scenarios (Overcooked, CyberDefense, etc.).
- Add CLI wrapper for stand-alone execution of the analyzer.
