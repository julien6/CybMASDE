# CybMASDE - Graphical User Interface (GUI) Reference

The **CybMASDE Graphical Interface** provides a visual, user-friendly way to configure and run the entire MAMAD workflow (from *Modeling* to *Training*, *Analyzing*, *Refining*, and *Transferring*).  
It is designed for researchers and engineers who prefer graphical interactions over CLI scripting.

---

## üöÄ Launching the Interface

Once CybMASDE is installed, to launch the GUI make sure your environmental API (Overcooked-AI REST API complying with `environment_api.py` in the `transferring` folder in project) is running, then from the main project directory open two terminal tabs.

In the first tab, open the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
source env/bin/activate      # POSIX; use env\Scripts\activate on Windows
cd api_server
python server.py
```

In a second tab, open the frontend with:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run start
```

Then, an native-like desktop Electron window should appears.\
If nothing appears, you better check logs at opening your browser at: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

From there, you can:

* Create and edit project configurations visually, 
* Launch and monitor the transferring and mta processes, 
* Inspect Auto-TEMM analysis results interactively.
* ...

The interface will open in a desktop window (based on Electron or PyQt, depending on your build).
You should see the **home screen** similar to the one below.

## üè† Home Screen

## üß† Training Configuration

![Training Configuration](assets/training.png)

The **Training** tab configures the **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** phase.

  + Directory where trained policies will be stored.
* **Statistics**

  + Monitored metrics such as reward evolution and convergence speed.

Example configuration snippet (training hyperparameters):

```json
{
  "algorithms": {
    "mappo": {
      "lr": 0.0005,
      "clip_param": 0.3,
      "entropy_coeff": 0.01
    }
  }
}
```

## üìä Analyzing Configuration

![Analyzing Configuration](assets/analyzing.png)

The **Analyzing** tab handles **Auto-TEMM** and **TEMM**-based trajectory analysis and explicability metrics.

### Sections

| Field                                      | Description                                      |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

To execute the pipeline through the GUI, use the **menu bar**:

**File ‚Üí Run Project**

![Start Running](assets/start_running.png)

This will launch the full **MAMAD process** (Modeling ‚Üí Training ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Refinement ‚Üí Transfer).
The logs are displayed in a terminal window integrated into the interface.

---

## üßæ Example: Running and Refining a Project

### Running Example

![Running Project](assets/running_project.png)

### At a Refinement Step

![Running at Refinement Point](assets/running_at_refinment_point.png)

During a refinement loop, the terminal prompts you:

```
Continue to the next refinement cycle? (Y/N)
```

You may accept ( `Y` ) to automatically proceed to the next loop or stop to manually review the resulting organizational specifications provided in `analyzing/inferred_organizational_specifications/organizational_specifications.json` also getting some help from visually rendered figures of trained agents' trajectories in `analyzing/figures` .
